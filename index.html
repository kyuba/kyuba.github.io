<p>Project kyuba was intended as an init and rc system for Unices, and as a successor to eINIT - <a href="http://git.einit.org/">http://git.einit.org/</a> ; however, the first step in implementing this programme had been to create a very minimalistic libc replacement. This libc replacement and the soon-to-follow 9p2000.u implementation then seem to have taken on a life of their own, which meant that development on the actual init programme kind of stalled after the first release.</p>

<p>To see all the projects, go to <a href="https://github.com/kyuba">https://github.com/kyuba</a> and have a browse. If you feel you can contribute in any way, you are very welcome to do so, just ping Magnus (<a href="https://github.com/jyujin" class="user-mention">@jyujin</a>).</p>
