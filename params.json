{"name":"git.kyuba.org","tagline":"","body":"### kyuba\r\nProject kyuba was intended as an init and rc system for Unices, and as a successor to eINIT - http://git.einit.org/ ; however, the first step in implementing this programme had been to create a very minimalistic libc replacement. This libc replacement and the soon-to-follow 9p2000.u implementation then seem to have taken on a life of their own, which meant that development on the actual init programme kind of stalled after the first release.\r\n\r\nTo see all the projects, go to https://github.com/kyuba and have a browse. If you feel you can contribute in any way, you are very welcome to do so, just ping Magnus (@jyujin).\r\n\r\nYou may find some old content of the original kyuba.org site archived at my blog: http://ef.gy/kyuba","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
